            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Coming from a family of writers and crafters, it was only natural that I inherited the creativity bug. As
                a kid, it appeared through an interest in making anything I could out of duct tape. Growing up, I went
                through various hobbies including cake decorating and a very brief jewelry making stage. But, when I
                landed in the yearbook classroom in high school it was more than just a phase or hobby. InDesign is
                where I first fell in love with digital design, and though I do frequently flirt with Illustrator and
                Photoshop, layout is the sweet spot for me. Web design has always felt like a natural extension of my
                passion for layout.</p>
            <p>Outside of digital, I also got creative in the self identity department with my name. At age 20, while
                living as a nanny in Seattle, I decided to change my name solely because I had never been a fan of my
                given one. The Seattle rain made me crave sunshine, so I chose Summer.</p>
            <p>My husband and I unexpectedly got the chance to relocate and now we’re moving back to our home state,
                exactly where we always wanted to be. In doing so, I’m leaving a relatively new job that has provided me
                with the opportunity to pursue my passions. I’m looking for a similarly energized team to collaborate
                and work alongside. I thrive in a team environment where we push ourselves to work harder and feed off
                of each others ideas. Progression, collaboration, and creativity drive my desire to find a new team in
                my old home.</p>

                <p>I mentioned before that I come from a family of crafters, this is something I inherited from both my
                    grandmothers. I love the slow pace of the needle and thread art.</p>

                <p>We enjoy doing a lot of things together including binge watching our latest TV obsession and
                    doing puzzles, but our favorite is always cooking in the kitchen together.</p>
